NaNoWriMo-Order
===============

Re-order WordPress blog posts categorized with "NaNoWriMo" so they read from Oldest to Newest

If you use your blog to write a novel, the posts should surface chronologically. This plugin reverses the nanowrimo category archive so people can read your novel, and removes it from the main blog feed so people don't read your novel in reverse. You need to create a category called "nanowrimo" then add a link to the nanowrimo category archive in Appearance, Menus
